# Injury_Code_Assist
Injury Code Assist is a web app made to view ICD-10 Chapter XIII codes. The idea behind the project is to provide a site like the WHO's (https://icd.who.int/browse10/2019/en#/M45-M49) with some improvements:

- Vietnamese translations
- Create a series of questions that allow users to quickly find the right code
- Provide clarification for aspects of the ICD
